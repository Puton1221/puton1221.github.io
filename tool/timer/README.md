## Localization
These utilities can be localized. If you wish to add your own translation, then edit the `timer.js` and `timer-selector.js` files, modifying the `translations` constant in `getMessage()` to have a new language code and the corresponding translations for each field. Pull requests for translations are open.

You can use [`?lang=test`](https://scpwiki.github.io/timer/timer-selector.html?lang=test) to see what the message keys for each part of the UI are, to aid in translation.
